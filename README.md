## Generic Electron Webpack docs

Based on `electron-webpack`, this project comes with...

* Use of [`webpack-dev-server`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) for development
* HMR for both `renderer` and `main` processes
* Use of [`babel-preset-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) that is automatically configured based on your `electron` version
* Use of [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to package and build a distributable electron application

Make sure to check out [`electron-webpack`'s documentation](https://webpack.electron.build/) for more details.
